Car rental application â€“ one of the feature problem statement

A vehicle can be rented for a trip. Vehicle can be a SUV, car, van, bus, etc.
The standard rate for a petrol vehicle for a standard trip is 15 Rs/Km. Additional 2 Rs/Km charge is applicable for AC vehicles. 
Diesel vehicles cost a rupee less than standard rate.
2% discount is applicable for bus on standard rate.
Additional charges of 1 Rs/Km/Person are charged if number of passengers exceeds the max limit of a vehicle.
Example distance:
                        Pune - Mumbai: 200 KM
                        Pune - Bangalore: 1000 KM
                        Mumbai - Delhi: 2050 KM
                        Mumbai - Chennai: 1234.5 KM
In this big car rental application you are tasked to develop an API which calculates the total expense for a given trip. Do not use any property file to store the values mentioned above. 
Instead think in terms of injectable interfaces to provide the information assuming members of your team will be responsible to develop the same. 
You develop a default implementation for the same where data is hard coded. Actual implementation of those may pull data from database, file or http service.
Example trip:    Swift, Diesel, NON AC, Pune-Mumbai-Bangalore-Pune, 3 Passengers

Changes in input:

1) Based on the above requirement, the input from the user must also include the vehicle type, such as car, bus, van. suv..
This was missing in the input provided. I have included it.
2) The fuel type, whether its diesel or petrol will be applicable to all the vehicles, including bus.
3) Validation not done if the number of passengers exceeds the number of seats in the vehicle. The calculation is based on the 
	maxlimit of a vehicle (hard coded) and the number of passengers, which is sent as input data.
